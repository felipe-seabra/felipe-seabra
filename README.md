#### About Me

I'm Felipe, born in Presidente Prudente (SP), I have approximately 10 years of experience (as an IT Infrastructure Analyst) working in several areas of technology in education.

I am currently a full-stack web development student at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/). My passions are: learning new things, coding, playing games, animals and looking for things to fix!

I have focused my time on studying languages such as Javascript, Node, MySQL, CSS, HTML Docker, Typescript, MongoDB and Python.
